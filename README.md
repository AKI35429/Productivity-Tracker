# Productivity-Tracker

With this application we wish to create a space where we can track our day to day Work Progress, with the help of interesting imagery like Graphs and charts which will motivate us be productive. It will track how a user spends their time on different activities and at the end of the day a graph will be displayed based on the time recorded for each activity. This will motivate users to be productive if they see they the leisure time they're taking versus the actual time when they're working. The platform will also have features like organizing tasks, creating to-do lists, setting reminders for important deadlines and taking notes.

## **Common Rules**

-   The repository is divided into several tasks. Each task will be opened subsequently for a limited amount of time and all the submissions have to be made within those allotted days only. No submission will be accepted after the allotted time ends. The details for the specific tasks and the time allotted for each can be found in their specific folders.
-   The submissions will be judged by the mentors and points will be allotted by them for each particular task based on various aspects.
